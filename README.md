# How to protect your site from temporary mails using api.testmail.top?

So, below there will be a boring description of the API, while you have enthusiasm, remember the main thing: the main response parameter is **"result":**, if this parameter is **true** - feel free to skip this EMAIL for registration, if **false**, then take your time - tell the user "Register with temporary mails are prohibited by resource policy".

Also, you have a trump card up your sleeve - this is the **"error":**, parameter: if everything goes well, then it is always **0**, if the user makes mistakes, then this parameter takes numerical values, you can, if you wish, set him on the right path, prompting him to check the correctness of the EMAIL input
